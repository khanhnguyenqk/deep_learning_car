# Deep Learning Car
A small 2D car driving simulation using neural network and genetic algorithm.

# Setup Environment
This project uses Anaconda environment. The enviroment yaml file is provided as 'environment.yml'. Set up enviroment by calling:
  ```conda env create -f environment.yml```
  
# Running project
Run project demo by calling
  ```python ./deepcar/raceEvent.py```
In raceEvent.py, there are some hyper parameters that could be adjusted.

To create a new race track, call
  ```python ./deepcar/raceTrackEditor.py```
	
Execute ```raceTrackEditor.py``` with ```-h``` option for more information.
